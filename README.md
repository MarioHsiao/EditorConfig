I can't compile your project, since I don't have VS 2010 installed.

This code should be Visual Studio 2010+ compatible though. All you have to do 
is to add the folders `Classify`, `Completion` and `ContentType` to 
the .editorconfig VS extension project and then add the missing references.

Sorry for such a lame pull request
